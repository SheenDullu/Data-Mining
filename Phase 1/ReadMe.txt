General:
Run Assignment.py to plot the scatter graph and bar graph of the features after PCA.
 The plotted figures would pop up.
Assuming their is a DataFolder which has the expected cvs data files.

File Description:
Assignment.py : This file consists of methods to extract the features from the raw cvs.
It reads the data and extract features of the insulin effects on the subjects. 
Performs PCA and plots the graph.
The bar plot describes for each of the eigenvectors as the individual weights of original features. 
Each value from a component are shown by unique color in the bar plot and the weights are represented by the length of the bar. 
The higher the weight value implies that the feature contributed to create such a principal component or an eigenvector.
